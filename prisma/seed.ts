 * Brings the system tables up to date. Nothing else.
 *
 * The seed owns exactly two kinds of row:
 *
 *   1. The `sys_*` tables — the bootstrap administrator, the permission
 *      catalogue, the seeded roles, and the fixed two-Company structure.
 *   2. The reference tables that behave as system data even though their names
 *      say otherwise: account types, document types, budget categories,
 *      partner categories, and the account category / subcategory skeleton the
 *      chart of accounts hangs off. Application logic reads these by label, so
 *      they are code in the same sense the permission catalogue is.
 *
 * Everything else — partners, cash & bank resources, currencies beyond the
 * reporting base, accounts, mappings, fiscal years and periods, budgets and
 * transactions — is business data that real users create through the
 * application. It is deliberately absent here.
 *
 * The seed is idempotent and never deletes business data. Rows are created when
 * missing and otherwise left alone, so running it against a live database is
 * safe: it adds what a new release introduced and touches nothing a user has
 * entered or adjusted.
 *
 * Run with: npm run db:seed

 * Brings the Budget Category rules and the Budget Category x Partner Category

 * a rule the user has already shaped through the GUI.**
 *
 * That distinction is the whole difficulty here. These rows are system data by
 * origin but user data by intent: the seed states where the model starts, and
 * Master > Klasifikasi is where it goes next. A sync that simply wrote the
 * declared rules back would silently undo a morning's work the first time
 * anyone ran `npm run db:seed` to pick up a new permission.
 *
 * So each half asks a question whose answer distinguishes "never set" from
 * "set to something else":
 *
 *   - Direction is backfilled only when **both** flags are false, which no real
 *     category ever is — a category that moves in no direction could classify
 *     nothing. That state means the row predates the column.
 *   - Mappings are seeded only when the category has **no rows at all**. One
 *     row, even a deactivated one, means somebody has been here.
 *
 * Neither half deletes anything, in keeping with the seeder's contract.
