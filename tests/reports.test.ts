/**
 * The two Cash Bank Report Views.
 *
 * A money report has one property that matters more than anything it displays:
 * **opening + in − out = closing**, for every subject and every period. A report
 * that cannot be checked on its own page is not evidence of anything, so most
 * of what follows is that identity, pushed at from the edges — entries exactly
 * on the boundaries, entries before the period, a period with nothing in it,
 * and a resource that was deactivated after it had already moved money.
 *
 * Fixtures are built here and removed again: the seed carries system data only.
