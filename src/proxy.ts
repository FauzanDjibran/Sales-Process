/**
 * Optimistic route protection.
 *
 * Proxy runs before every route, including prefetches, so it only checks
 * whether a session cookie is present — no database lookup, no permission
 * evaluation. That makes it a redirect convenience, NOT a security boundary:
 * a forged cookie gets past this file and is then rejected by the real check.
 *
 * The enforcement lives in `src/lib/siba/auth.ts`, called by `(app)/layout.tsx`,
 * by every page, and by every Server Action. Deleting this file would cost
 * nothing but a tidy redirect.
 *
 * (`proxy.ts` is Next 16's name for what used to be `middleware.ts` — see
 * `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/proxy.md`.)

/**
 * `/api/health` is here because whatever polls it — an uptime monitor, a
 * reverse proxy, a deploy script waiting for the new process — has no session
 * cookie, and a 302 to the login page reads as "alive" to most of them. The
 * route itself reports only up/down and never describes the system.
