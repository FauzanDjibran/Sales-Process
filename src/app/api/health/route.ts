/**
 * Liveness and readiness, for whatever is watching the process.
 *
 * The one Route Handler in the application, and the one route reachable without
 * a session besides `/login` — an uptime monitor or a reverse proxy has no
 * cookie to present. `src/proxy.ts` exempts it for that reason.
 *
 * It says only whether the process is up and whether the database answers.
 * Deliberately no version, no schema detail, no error text: a public endpoint
 * that describes the inside of the system is a reconnaissance tool, and the
 * operator can read the real reason in the server log.
