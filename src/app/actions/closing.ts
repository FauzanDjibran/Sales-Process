/**
 * Closing a fiscal year.
 *
 * The rules live in `closing.ts` rather than here, for the reason every other
 * write path in the application does: an action resolves its caller from a
 * session cookie, which a test process does not have, so a rule written here
 * could only be exercised through the screen. `executeClosing` re-runs every
 * blocking check itself before it writes anything — the checklist the user read
 * is not trusted to still be true.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** matching "reopen". A close posts a journal, and
 * a posted journal is never reversed (CLAUDE.md §12), so undoing one would mean
 * writing the one kind of entry this application refuses.
