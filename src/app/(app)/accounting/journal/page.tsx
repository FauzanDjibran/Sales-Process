/**
 * The Journal register.
 *
 * Both kinds live here: journals a posting produced, which are final from the
 * moment they exist, and manual journals, which are drafted below this page at
 * `/new` and `/[id]/edit` and become the same thing once posted.
 *
 * One Company at a time, chosen from the Companies this reader's permissions
 * open. Each Company keeps its own books and its own chart of accounts, so a
 * register holding both reads as one set of duplicated rows — the same reason
 * the Chart of Accounts tree shows one Company (CLAUDE.md §12).
