/**
 * The Opening Balance register.
 *
 * Read-only: there is no `/new` and no `/[id]/edit` below this route, because
 * a snapshot is written by a fiscal year's close or injected by a developer
 * before the application has any history, and is immutable once it exists.
 *
 * One Company at a time, chosen from the Companies this reader's permissions
 * open — each keeps its own chart of accounts, so a register holding both
 * reads as duplicated rows (CLAUDE.md §12).
