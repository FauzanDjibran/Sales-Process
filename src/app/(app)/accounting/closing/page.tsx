/**
 * The Fiscal Year Closing workspace.
 *
 * Bespoke rather than registry, for the reason Budget and Finance are: this is
 * not a record with fields. It is a checklist, a preview of an entry, and one
 * irreversible act, against a pair — a Company and a year — that no single
 * table holds.
 *
 * Both halves of that pair live in the URL, so a run is linkable and the page
 * stays a Server Component querying directly. A year the reader has not chosen
 * yet means no plan at all, which is a different screen from a plan that is
 * blocked.
