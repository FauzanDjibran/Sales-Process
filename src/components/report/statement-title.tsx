/**
 * What a statement is, stated on the statement itself.
 *
 * A figure that leaves the screen — a screenshot in a chat, a page on a desk —
 * no longer has the filter beside it, so the output names itself: the report,
 * the Company by its label, the mode, each column's dates, and when it was
 * produced. Two compact lines at the top of the card and nothing more, because
 * the sticky header above it (filter included) keeps the space it has.
 *
 * It replaces the run stamp at the foot for these reports rather than adding a
 * second one: the time the figures were read is stated once, here.
