/**
 * The filter for every report whose subject is a **set**: several accounts for
 * the `account-period` reports, several Partners for the `subledger-period`
 * ones, plus an inclusive date range.
 *
 * Several, because reading a ledger nearly always means reading a pair — the
 * cash account against whatever it moved against, or two Partners settling with
 * each other — and making that two page loads is what makes checking the books
 * tedious. The chosen subjects go into the URL as `accounts=3,17,42`, so a run
 * of four is still one link.
 *
 * One component rather than one per subject: the two differ in their labels and
 * in the query parameter they write, which is what props are for. A second copy
 * would be the drift `tests/design-system.test.ts` exists to stop.
 *
 * It renders into the sticky page header (`.rfil`), so it is both the control
 * and the statement of what the figures below cover. That is why the controls
 * are compact and why the chosen subjects are chips on a second row rather than
 * a wider picker: the header's height is the report's lost viewport.
 *
 * Two rows, in the order they are filled in — the Company (and, on Buku
 * Subjek, the book) with the subjects, then the period — with *Tampilkan* in
 * the header's action slot, top right, like Simpan on a form.
