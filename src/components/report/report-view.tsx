/**
 * The chrome every Report View wears.
 *
 * A Report View is a screen whose job is to *show* a report, and the convention
 * it follows is recorded in CLAUDE.md §12. Three things belong to every one of
 * them, and they live here so no report has to remember them:
 *
 *   1. the page header — module, report name;
 *   2. the **filter**, inside that header. The header is sticky, so the
 *      criteria travel with the page and are on screen wherever the reader has
 *      scrolled to. That is what a restatement underneath the bar used to buy,
 *      at the cost of a slab of vertical space on every run — so the `.critbar`
 *      is gone and the filter itself is the statement of what was run;
 *   3. a **one-sentence** footnote and the run timestamp. One sentence because
 *      each of these had grown to four or five, restating rules the screen
 *      already obeys, so the one clause that changed how a column should be
 *      read was buried in a paragraph nobody finishes.
 *
 * The body is passed in, because report bodies genuinely differ — a ledger is
 * rows over time, a balance is a matrix over subjects. Only what is common is
 * shared; nothing here tries to be a generic report engine.
 *
 * The header carries no `.ph-sub`: the description belongs to the menu entry
 * that led here, and repeating it on a sticky header costs the report a line of
 * viewport on every scroll. What a reader needs in order to *read* the figures
 * is in the footnote, at the foot, where it is read once.
