/**
 * Several of something, chosen one at a time.
 *
 * A searchable `Combobox` that adds, and a row of chips that remove. It is the
 * shape a set wants once the list it is drawn from can grow: a checkbox grid
 * states every option whether or not anyone will ever pick it, so it costs
 * vertical space in proportion to the catalogue rather than to the answer, and
 * stops being scannable the moment the catalogue is long. This costs one line
 * plus one chip per choice, and it is searchable, which a grid is not.
 *
 * The picker only ever offers what is **not** already chosen, so the same
 * option cannot be added twice and the list shortens as the answer grows.
 *
 * It renders the two pieces and nothing around them — no label, no field
 * wrapper — because it is used both inside a form `Field` and inside a report's
 * filter bar, which supply their own chrome.
