/**
 * A record's own history, at the foot of its form.
 *
 * One component for every form that has one — registry entities, Budget, Cash
 * Bank Transaction, Funding Request, User and Role — because a repeated control
 * is a component (CLAUDE.md §12) and an audit trail that reads differently on
 * six screens is worse than none: a reader who learns to read a Budget's trace
 * should be able to read a Partner's without relearning it.
 *
 * **Newest first.** A history is read backwards — the entry somebody opened the
 * panel for is the most recent one, and putting the oldest at the top would push
 * it below the fold on any record with a long life. Older context is what
 * scrolling down is for.
 *
 * It states only what `audit_log` actually knows: that something happened, which
 * step it was, when, and by whom. It does **not** claim to know what changed,
 * because the table stores no snapshot (§17), and a panel that implied otherwise
 * would be worse than one that says less.
