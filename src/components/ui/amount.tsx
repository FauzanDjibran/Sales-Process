/**
 * A money figure printed in a table or a total — mono, grouped, with its
 * currency. The one way a document screen prints an amount, because the
 * Journal had drifted to the sans-serif body font while every other document
 * printed its figures in `.mny`.
 *
 * `nil` decides what a zero reads as: a dash where a column is one side of a
 * pair (a debit line has no kredit), or the figure itself where a nil is an
 * answer somebody checks.
 *
 * `ledger` prints it the accountant's way — a negative in parentheses rather
 * than a minus, and still with its currency, like every other amount in the
 * application. The Journal and the General Ledger print every figure so.
