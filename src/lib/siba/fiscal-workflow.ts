/**
 * The Fiscal Year lifecycle, written once and read by both sides.
 *
 *   Draft ──open──> Open ──(closing process)──> Closed
 *
 * A fiscal year is not a record with a status field somebody types. It is
 * created as Draft, is *activated* into Open by a deliberate act — which is
 * what generates its twelve periods — and leaves Open only through a closing
 * process. None of those steps is a value anyone picks from a dropdown, which
 * is why `status` is not an editable field on the Fiscal Year form at all.
 *
 * Open is a one-way door: periods exist behind it and budgets are already
 * grouped by them, so returning a year to Draft would strand data inside a year
 * that claims never to have started.
 *
 * **Closed is a rollup, not a status somebody sets.** Closing happens per
 * Company: the induk can shut 2026 while the anak is still finishing it, and
 * that state lives in `acc_fiscal_closing`. The year itself reads Closed only
 * once every Company has closed it. That is also why `close` is the one
 * transition here that is not run from the Fiscal Year's own header — it needs
 * a Company, a checklist and a preview of the entry it is about to write, so
 * it carries `runAt` and the header links there instead.
 *
 * Client-safe on purpose — no `server-only`, no database import.

 * Why a year may not be activated, or null when it may.

 * **Any number of years may stand Open** — the business has carried several at

 * keeps each one honest. What may not happen is a year opening **behind** a
 * close: that close wrote the next year's Opening Balance snapshot, and every
 * report opening after it stands on the snapshot, so a posting into an older
 * year would move a figure the snapshot has already frozen. The refusal names
 * the closes in the way, because "not allowed" is not actionable.
 *
 * Pure, and takes the later closes rather than reading them, so the rule is
 * exercised directly instead of against whatever the database holds.
