/**
 * Which currency is the base, and which resource may settle which document.
 *
 * Until now nothing in the application could ask either question. The base
 * currency existed only as a default inside `prisma/seed.ts`, and currency was
 * a filter rather than a measure: a document took its currency from its Cash &
 * Bank resource, and a Budget had to match it exactly. Multi-currency separates
 * the three, so the relationship between them needs saying somewhere.
 *
 * **Crossing goes through the base currency only.** A foreign document may be
 * settled from a resource in its own currency or from a base-currency resource,
 * and from nothing else. USD settles from USD or IDR; EUR from EUR or IDR; USD
 * never from EUR, and IDR never from anything but IDR.
 *
 * That is narrower than the source specification, which also admits a foreign
 * document paid from a *third* currency's account — the case needing a cross
 * rate applied on top of the account's own rate. Removing it means **the only
 * rate this system ever holds converts a foreign currency to base**. There is
 * no EUR-to-USD rate to enter, store or source, which is why `fx.ts` needs one
 * multiplication where the specification needs two.
 *
 * Client-safe on purpose — no `server-only`, no database import, no dependency
 * on any other module. The form narrows its pickers with these rules and the
 * Server Action refuses with the same ones, which is the only way the two
 * cannot disagree.

/**
 * The reporting base currency.
 *
 * Stated here because the rules below are meaningless without it, and because
 * a page cannot reach the database to ask. It is a currency *label*, matching
 * `ref_currency.currency_label`.
 *
 * **This is the only statement of it.** `prisma/seed.ts` imports this constant
 * rather than reading `ERP_BASE_CURRENCY` from the environment, which it used
 * to do — a base currency that could be changed by a deployment variable while
 * the books were already measured in it was a way to invalidate every stored
 * base figure at once. Only the currency's *name* is still configurable
 * (`ERP_BASE_CURRENCY_NAME`), because a name is not a measure.
