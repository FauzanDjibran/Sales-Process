/**
 * The accounting journal.
 *
 * A journal is *produced by a posting*, and `postJournal` is the only thing
 * that ever produces one. A **posted** journal is immutable: nothing updates,
 * deletes or reverses one, and a correction is a new journal exactly as a
 * corrected document is a new document (concept doc §15).
 *
 * ## Automatic and manual journals
 *
 * Almost every journal here is written *by* a business document being posted —
 * a Cash Bank Transaction, a confirmed Funding Request — and is `Posted` the
 * moment it exists, because it records something that has already happened.
 *
 * A **manual** journal is typed by a person: a depreciation entry, an accrual,
 * a reclassification. It is saved `Draft` first, edited freely while it is one,
 * and reaches `Posted` through `postDraftJournal`, which runs **the same
 * validation** `postJournal` does. A draft is not accounting — it has no
 * posting date, and no report can see it — so the frozen guarantee is unchanged
 * in substance: nothing is in the books until a posting put it there, and once
 * it is there it never moves.
 *
 * Which accounts a manual journal may touch is deliberately **not** decided
 * here. That question needs the Cash Bank Book, the subject books and the
 * System Defaults, and this module imports none of them — it is a book and
 * books depend on nothing (CLAUDE.md §3). `lib/erp/manual-journal.ts` owns
 * those rules and hands this module lines it has already checked.
 *
 * **The journal is measured in base currency.** `debit_amount` and
 * `kredit_amount` are rupiah; `trx_amount`, `currency_id` and `exchange_rate`
 * carry the transaction-currency face of the same line. That is concept doc
 * §16: the operational books keep both measures, and the General Ledger is
 * base.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating plainly: **one journal may now hold lines in two
 * different currencies** — a foreign document paid from a base-currency
 * resource produces exactly that — and it balances only in base. Every journal
 * in this application used to be single-currency, and three places in the code
 * relied on it.
 *
 * **The balance is enforced here and nowhere else.** `postJournal` refuses to
 * write a journal whose base debits and credits differ, and because it is
 * always called inside the posting transaction, a refusal rolls the whole
 * posting back. That is the whole guarantee: if every journal balances, every
 * sum of journals balances, and a trial balance that does not is a system fault
 * rather than a data-entry one.
 *
 * Only the General Ledger reads these lines. The Cash Bank Book and the subject
 * books are written alongside the journal in the same transaction and never
 * derived from it (§2.5, §11.7).

 * through it, and that is a system fault rather than a bookkeeping one. The
 * Trial Balance says so on its own page.
 *
 * Base is the only measure worth asking in. A journal holding a USD line and
 * an IDR line has no transaction-currency total at all, so the question only
 * means anything once both are valued.
 *
 * **Posted only.** A manual journal halfway through being typed does not
 * balance, and that is not a fault — reporting it here would put a system-fault
 * warning on the Trial Balance for every draft anybody had open.
