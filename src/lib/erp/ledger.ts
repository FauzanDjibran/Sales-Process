/**
 * The General Ledger and the Trial Balance.
 *
 * Both derive from journal lines, and they are the **only** things that do —
 * the operational books are independent stores written alongside the journal
 * (concept doc §2.5, §2.6). The subject is the account: a General Ledger is an
 * account's movement over a period, and a Trial Balance is every account's
 * opening, movement and closing side by side.
 *
 * **Signed by normal balance.** An account's balance moves the way its normal
 * balance does: a Debit account rises on the debit side, a Kredit account on
 * the credit side. Reporting a raw debit-minus-credit for a liability would
 * print every payable as a negative number, which is not how a ledger reads.
 *
 * **Measured in base currency, on one scale.** Concept doc §11.2 and §16 say
 * the General Ledger uses the base currency, and it now does: every journal
 * line stores what it was worth in rupiah, so both reports read one column and
 * produce one set of figures.
 *
 * This replaces the per-currency grouping these reports carried while there was
 * no rate anywhere in the system. That was a deliberate deviation, recorded as
 * such, and it could not survive multi-currency for a plainer reason than
 * fidelity to the concept doc: **a journal may now hold two currencies**, so
 * there is no longer any transaction-currency total to group by. A USD line and
 * an IDR line in one entry have no common measure until both are valued.
 *
 * The transaction-currency face is not lost — it travels on each entry, so a
 * reader can see that a rupiah figure came from three hundred dollars. It is
 * simply not what anything is totalled in.
