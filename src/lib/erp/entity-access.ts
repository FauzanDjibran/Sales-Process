/**
 * Which permission each registry entity's operations require.
 *
 * The Master module is registry-driven, so its authorization is registry-driven
 * too: one map instead of a check written out in every page and action. Adding
 * an entity means adding its row here — the same shape as adding it to
 * `entities.ts`.
 *
 * Client-safe (no `server-only`, no database import): the list and form
 * components read the same map the Server Actions enforce, so a hidden button
 * and a rejected action can never disagree about which permission is at stake.
