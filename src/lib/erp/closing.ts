/**
 * Closing a fiscal year.
 *
 * One act: the year's profit and loss is moved into equity, the position that
 * remains is written as the next year's Opening Balance, and the year's
 * closing row is stamped. Either all of that
 * happened or none of it did.
 *
 * ## Laba/Rugi Tahun Berjalan is computed, never posted
 *
 * The closing journal moves the result **straight into Laba/Rugi Tahun
 * Sebelumnya**. The current-year account is a Balance Sheet *presentation
 * line* — Σ Pendapatan − Σ Biaya for the year still open — and nothing ever
 * posts to it. Posting it as a pass-through would leave an account whose
 * balance is permanently zero while the Neraca still had to compute the
 * running figure anyway; posting it and holding it for a year would leave the
 * line named "tahun berjalan" carrying the *previous* year's result for twelve
 * months, which is the commonest way this account is misread in practice.
 *
 * The cost is real and accepted: after closing, "2026 made 250 juta" is no
 * longer a balance. It stays readable as a movement on the accumulated
 * account's General Ledger, and on the closing journal itself.
 *
 * ## What is written
 *
 *   a journal   dated 31/12 of the year being closed — the one journal in the
 *               application that may be dated after the day it was posted
 *   `OPB/…`     the next year's snapshot, taken *after* the closing journal,
 *               so it is a balance sheet by construction
 *   the closing row, and `AccFiscalYear.status`
 *
 * ## Irreversible
 *
 * Nothing reopens a closed year. `checkPostingPeriod` refuses every posting
 * into it afterwards, on every posting path, and there is
 * no un-close: a posted journal is never reversed, so undoing a close would
 * mean reversing one.
 *
 * ## Module boundary
 *
 * This file names no other module's table. Balances come from `ledger.ts`,
 * which is the one thing allowed to derive from journal lines; journals are
 * written through `journal.ts`; snapshots through `opening-balance.ts`; and
 * the calendar records its own state through `fiscal.ts`.
