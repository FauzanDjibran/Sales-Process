/**
 * What an audit row *means*, in the UI's language.
 *
 * `audit_log.action` is the coarse verb — TAMBAH, UPDATE, HAPUS — and it cannot
 * answer the question a record's history is opened for. Submitting, approving,
 * rejecting, posting and confirming are all writes, so all five read as UPDATE:
 * a Budget's history would print "Diubah · Diubah · Diubah" and say nothing
 * about who approved it or when it closed. `audit_log.event` carries the
 * specific step, and this file is where a step becomes a sentence.
 *
 * **The label is not stored.** Each lifecycle event resolves through the
 * workflow table that already owns it — `BUDGET_TRANSITIONS`,
 * `TRANSACTION_TRANSITIONS`, `JOURNAL_TRANSITIONS`,
 * `FISCAL_YEAR_TRANSITIONS` — so the word a button
 * says and the word its history entry says are the same string, and adding a
 * transition is a row in one table rather than a row in one table plus a label
 * here plus a migration.
 *
 * Client-safe on purpose — no `server-only`, no database import — because the
 * panel that renders a history is a client component, the same way every
 * workflow table it reads is.
