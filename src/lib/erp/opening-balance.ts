/**
 * The Opening Balance store.
 *
 * An Opening Balance is a **snapshot**: where one Company's accounts stood at
 * the start of one fiscal year, written once and never touched again. It is
 * not a book — there is no running total to keep and no further entry to
 * append, because the thing it records happened at a single instant.
 *
 * It exists for two reasons, and they are different reasons:
 *
 *  - a closed year has to hand the next one its position in a form somebody
 *    can read, rather than as an instruction to re-add every journal line ever
 *    posted;
 *  - and the General Ledger and the Trial Balance compute their openings from
 *    it instead of scanning from the first historical transaction.
 *    `openingBasisFor` at the foot of this file is that second job, and the
 *    property it lives or dies by is **equivalence**: for the same account and
 *    the same date, the snapshot-based opening equals the full-scan opening to
 *    the cent. A database that has never closed a year has no snapshot to
 *    stand on and produces exactly the figures it produced before any of this
 *    existed.
 *
 * ## Immutable, and read-only in the UI
 *
 * There is no create form, no edit path, and no delete. A snapshot is written
 * by a fiscal year's close, or by a developer injecting go-live figures
 * directly into the database before the application has any history. Nothing
 * a user does through the GUI produces one, and nothing changes one
 * afterwards: a snapshot that could be edited would be a second, unverifiable
 * answer to a question the journal already answers.
 *
 * ## The grain is the journal line's grain
 *
 * One line per `(account, partner?)` pair — a Hutang account owed to three
 * branches produces three lines, and an account naming no Partner produces one
 * line with a null partner. There is no parent row holding an account's total,
 * because that figure is the sum of its children: the materialised balances
 * elsewhere in SIBA are allowed only because a rebuild function can re-derive
 * them, and an immutable snapshot has no rebuild.
 *
 * The pairs come from the posted journal lines **as they actually are**
 * (`closingBalances` in `ledger.ts`), never from `acc_account.require_partner`.
 * Reading the flag would drop a partner-bearing balance sitting on an
 * unflagged account, and would invent a null-partner line for an account that
 * has none.
 *
 * ## Base currency only
 *
 * There is no currency column and no rate. The journal, the General Ledger and
 * the Trial Balance are base-currency statements (concept doc §11.2, §16), and
 * a snapshot of them is the same measure. The transaction-currency face of
 * what produced a balance stays on the journal lines that produced it.
 *
 * This module owns `acc_opening_balance` and `acc_opening_balance_line` and
 * nothing else names them. It imports only the shared kernel, so it can be
 * written into from inside somebody else's posting transaction — which is
 * exactly how a close will use it.
