/**
 * Runs a command against the deployed Neon database instead of the local one.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript rather than TypeScript, deliberately: this is a process
 * launcher, so it has to set the environment before the real command and its
 * `tsx` loader start. It cannot itself be loaded by `tsx`.
 *
 * The connection lives in `.env.neon`, which the `.env*` rule already gitignores.
 * Create it by hand from Vercel's own snippet — Storage -> erp-postgres ->
 * Show Metadata & Quickstart -> Show secret -> Copy Snippet — and paste the
 * whole thing in. Nothing here ever prints a secret.
 *
 * Three rules it enforces, because each one has already cost an hour:
 *
 *   1. It connects through DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED, never DATABASE_URL. Neon's
 *      pooled endpoint runs pgbouncer in transaction mode and cannot execute
 *      DDL, so a migration against it fails partway and leaves the schema in
 *      the half-applied state `startup-check.ts` exists to refuse.
 *   2. It parses `.env.neon` itself rather than letting a shell source it. The
 *      connection strings contain `&` (from `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=
 *      require`), which a shell reads as "run the rest in the background" —
 *      silently setting only half the variables.
 *   3. A destructive command needs `--confirm` spelled out, the same protection
 *      `scripts/truncate-transactions.ts` already uses. The local `db:reset`
 *      drops a database somebody can rebuild in a minute; this one drops the
 *      books of a running deployment.
